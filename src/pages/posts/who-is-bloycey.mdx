My path into tech wasn't traditional. I didn't study tech, I didn't write code as a teenager, and I never even really considered myself a _computer person_. When I went to university my friends struggled through their engineering degrees while I became a walking cliche - a long haired, barefoot, double-major in Philosophy, arts degree student.

I don't really have any regrets about this - I immensely enjoyed sitting in the UQ great court reading Nietzche - however once I graduated I was lacking a clear career path.

For a while I jumped from various casual jobs. I got a job at the Queensland Performing Arts Center (that I still hold 11yrs later), and briefly worked as a waiter. But the most promising job was a marketing role for a home-brewing company called Brewer's Choice.

There was nothing glamourous about Brewer's Choice. I was working for minimum wage on a barely functional computer updating marketing materials for a target audience who really didn't care much about marketing (they just wanted a cheap way to make beer). But there was _one thing_ that I got from this job, and it was an interest in websites.

Part of my role was managing an old Wordpress online store. It was a typical scenario - they were using a free wordpress theme that had been hacked at over the years and frankensteined with so many bloated plugins that it was slow, difficult to work with, and confusing. Nonetheless, trying to get this thing functional quickly became _my favourite part of the job_.

I desperately wanted to make the website better but didn't have the skills, so I took the most highly rated Udemy course on Web Development - [This one](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) by Jonas Schmedtmann. This course was the catalyst for my transition into tech. I got great satisfication in putting together my first site, and was immediately hooked on the fast feedback loop of front-end development. Despite only knowing the very basics of HTML and CSS (and the tiniest bit of JS) I felt like with enough effort I could build whatever I wanted.

Over the next 2 years I experienced the most flexible and enjoyable work life I've ever had - I continued working casually in marketing, while also working at QPAC, driving for Uber, and completing sporadic freelance website builds for local businesses. These 2 years flew by and didn't feel like work at all. I kicked off my github and made all sorts of strange and wonderful things (which are still there). I became addicted to the _making stuff on the web_: Having and idea, sketching it out, planning the code, making the thing. I knew that this is what I wanted to do as a career.

After getting my first job as a junior web developer I then got another couple of coding jobs before feeling like something was missing. As a coder I was just implementing designs that were already given to me - what happened to that feeling of complete ownership that only comes from doing the full process yourself? Could I get a job where I could both design _and_ write code?

Well yes and no. The idea of the hybrid designer-dev, AKA the _unicorn_ developer, does exist at some large companies (they are called [UX Engineers](https://design.google/jobs/ux-engineer/) at Google) it's just not a very common role in Australia.

Each job I've taken since my introduction to tech has endeavoured to get a little closer to this dream hybrid role. The type of role where I can spend half my time designing interfaces and the other half implementing them, assisting with design systems, and advocating for accessibility.

I'll get there one day üôè

Maybe you're a _unicorn_ developer too, trying to find your fit in industry that prefers specialisation. If so, I hope that this blog can be useful to you - I will post a mix of design and development resources, opinions, and tutorials.
