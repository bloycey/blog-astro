Why were there no waiters at the developer conference?

> Because it was a serverless function.

Ok, now that I've got that out of my system I'd like to tell you all about how I used [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) to manage a subscriber list for my blog.

The first question you might be wondering is why you'd got through the bother of setting up a database for storing subscribers when there are so many third-party providers that do exactly this ([Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) and [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/) are 2 popular options). It's a question that I asked myself too!

There are a few reasons why I decided to store my subscribers independently in my own database:

1. I'm indecisive and didn't know exactly how I was going to use the data. Self hosting the data is a lot more flexible than using a third-party provider;
2. I want to spend as little money as possible! Supabase is very generous on their free tier so it suits me nicely.
3. This is a personal blog so part of the fun is learning new things and building things myself!

Let's get right into it!

## The Markup

There's nothing too complex going on here, just a simple HTML form element with a few inputs.

```html
<!--HTML -->
<form id="subscribe-form" name="subscribe">
	<fieldset>
		<label for="name-field"> Name: </label>
		<input
			type="text"
			name="name"
			required="true"
			id="name-field"
			placeholder="Colonel Mustard"
		/>
	</fieldset>
	<fieldset class="visually-hidden">
		<label for="last-name-subscribe-field">Last Name:</label>
		<input
			type="text"
			id="last-name-subscribe-field"
			name="last_name"
			autocomplete="off"
			tabindex="-1"
		/>
	</fieldset>
	<fieldset>
		<label for="email-field">Email:</label>
		<input
			type="email"
			name="email"
			id="email-field"
			required="true"
			placeholder="thecolonel@mustard.com"
		/>
	</fieldset>
	<input type="submit" value="Subscribe" />
</form>
```

ðŸ¤” But hold up, what's with the `visually-hidden` class on the middle fieldset? That's a [honeypot](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)>)! It's a hidden field that's designed to trick bots into filling it out. If the field is filled out then we know we've caught a bot and we can ignore the submission.

I've added the honeypot to a believable field with the name attribute of `last-name` (I'm not collecting a last name, but bots don't know this!). Bots are getting more and more clever so don't go naming the field "honeypot" or there's a chance that a smart bot won't fall for your trap!

The `visually-hidden` class applies the following CSS, which just yeets the fieldset off the left-hand side of the page - out of view for any human. It's also got a a `tabindex` of `-1` so that it's not focusable by keyboard users.

```css
/* CSS */
.visually-hidden {
	position: absolute;
	left: -9999px;
}
```

Next up we've got some JS to handle the form submission and shoot the data off to our serverless function via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I've heard great things about [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)too, so you could try Vercel, but my experience with Netlify has been excellent so I'll be sticking with them.

```js
// JS

const subscribeForm = document.getElementById("subscribe-form");

subscribeForm.addEventListener("submit", async event => {
	// We are using JS so don't refresh the page.
	event.preventDefault();

	// Format the form data into an object
	const formData = Object.fromEntries(new FormData(subscribeForm));

	// Send the data to our netlify serverless function
	await fetch("/.netlify/functions/add-subscriber", {
		method: "POST",
		body: JSON.stringify({
			name: formData.name,
			email: formData.email,
			last_name: formData.last_name
		})
	}).then(response => response.json());

	// Reset the form
	subscribeForm.reset();
});
```

The `Object.fromEntries(new FormData(subscribeForm));` is a neat trick that takes the form data and converts it into an object like this:

```js
// JS
{
	name: "Colonel Mustard",
	email: "thecolonel@mustard.com",
}
```

From here the netlify serverless function can receive our feth request and respond accordingly. Notice that if there is anything in the last_name field I immediately return a 500 status and don't hit the supabase database.

```js
//JS
import * as dotenv from "dotenv";
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";

dotenv.config();

// Create a single supabase client for interacting with your database
const supabase = createClient(process.env.DATABASE, process.env.DATABASE_KEY);

export const handler = async (event, context) => {
	const { email, name, last_name } = JSON.parse(event.body);

	if (last_name) {
		return {
			statusCode: 500,
			body: JSON.stringify({
				status: 500,
				message: "Honeypot triggered"
			})
		};
	}

	const { data, error } = await supabase
		.from("subscribers")
		.insert({ email, name })
		.select();

	return {
		statusCode: 200,
		body: JSON.stringify({
			status: 200,
			message: data,
			error: error
		})
	};
};
```
