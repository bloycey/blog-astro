Every week I end up hoarding a heap of tabs on my phone. Here is where I dump all the interesting links that I don't want to lose or might want to reference again later.

You'll get mostly dev and design links but also the odd bit of whatever hobby I'm into at the time (currently it's chess!). Enjoy!

<summary>Design üé®</summary>

### [Design Techniques List](https://anthonyhobday.com/sideprojects/visualtechniques/)

A list of visual design techniques. I wish I'd put together a similar list when I started out in design!

### [Rive App](https://rive.app/)

I'd come accross Lottie before as a standalone, portable graphics format but this seems even better again. Would love to get into exploring interactive graphics some day!

### [Random Accessible Color Palettes](https://randoma11y.com/)

Some wild color matches, but I love it.

### [Setting up a screen reader correctly](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/testing-environment-setup/)

Pretty easy on Mac. More difficult on windows

<summary>Development üë®‚Äçüíª</summary>

### [Console Ninja](https://console-ninja.com/)

A tool that lets you view the results of your console logs directly in your code editor.

### [Grug Brain](https://grugbrain.dev/)

Probably the least pretentious and most accurate take on software development that you'll ever read.

### [web.dev Learn Accessibility Course](https://web.dev/learn/accessibility/)

This looks really comprehensive and could be a great place to start if you're looking to learn about accessibility.

### [Motion One - Motion Library](https://motion.dev/)

To be fair I haven't used this yet, but I love that it's build on the native Web Animations API and is lovely and lightweight.

### [Sliding Pill Menu with Tailwind](https://play.tailwindcss.com/Qd98eMhkxy)

I hadn't seen the `peer` syntax in CSS before and this illustrates a nice use case with a smooth animation.

<summary>Other Interesting Links ü§î</summary>

### [Riff Fusion](https://www.riffusion.com/about)

This is like ChatGPT but for music. This page outlines how they achieved it and it's a fascinating read.

### [Building a virtual machine inside ChatGPT](https://www.engraved.blog/building-a-virtual-machine-inside/)

Absolutely mind-bending stuff.

### [Why the super rich are inevitable](https://pudding.cool/2022/12/yard-sale/)

The pudding posts essay format posts that are always of a very high quality. Their articles are also very interactive ([the ABC do a similar thing](https://www.abc.net.au/news/interactives/)) that feels like the way forward for news where people's attention span for traditional written articles is limited. This particular article about wealth disparity tackles a political argument from a hard-date statistical perspective and I found it very compelling and engaging.

### [Tigers Modern Study](https://lichess.org/study/CoHp4wPV/nYXDb85f)

Been trying the modern lately, it feels nice to play.

### [Hippo Study](https://lichess.org/study/tHZUbLOD)

Sometimes the Tigers Modern doesn't work out and it's easy enough to transpose into the Hippo instead. I know it's somewhat dubious but for some reason that makes me like it even more.

### [Anti London Study](https://lichess.org/study/rxrdqKAi)

Gotta remember to try this!
